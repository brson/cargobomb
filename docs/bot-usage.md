# Bot usage

Crater can be controlled in the rust-lang/rust repo thanks to the GitHub bot
[@craterbot](https://github.com/craterbot). The bot replies to every command in
the comments of issues and pull requests, if the command is in its own line and
is prefixed with the bot's username.

For example, to check if the bot is alive you can write this comment:

```
@craterbot ping
```

And the bot will reply to you.

## Tutorial: creating an experiment for a PR

[h-tutorial]: #tutorial-creating-an-experiment-for-a-pr

When you want to create an experiment to check if a PR is breaking some
third-party code, the first thing is to request a **try build** to get a valid
toolchain. You can do that with the `@bors try` GitHub comment.

Once the try build is done, you can get the SHA of the start and end commits.
Bors should have posted a comment like this in the thread:

> âŒ› Trying commit XXXXXXX with merge YYYYYYY...

The end commit is `YYYYYYY`, while the start commit is the first of its two
parents (both should be merge commits by bors):

![Where to look for the commits](images/pr-try-commit.png)

You must prefix the start commit with `master#`, and the end commit with
`try#`, and both of them should be written with the full 40-chars hash.

Then, you choose the [experiment mode you want to use][h-experiment-modes], and
type up the command in your GitHub PR:

```
@craterbot run start=master#fullhash end=try#fullhash mode=check-only
```

## Available experiment modes

[h-experiment-modes]: #available-experiment-modes

The following experiment modes are currently available:

* `build-and-test`: run `cargo build` and `cargo test` on every crate
* `build-only`: run `cargo build` on every crate
* `check-only`: run `cargo check` on every crate (faster)
* `clippy`: run `cargo clippy` on every crate
* `rustdoc`: run `cargo doc --no-deps` on every crate

The mode you should use depends on what your experiment is testing:

* If your PR rejects some code that was previously accepted you can use
 `check-only` (or `build-only` if the change involves codegen or later
  compilation stages)
* Otherwise just use `build-and-test`, even if it will be slower to run

## Automatic experiment names

[h-experiment-names]: #automatic-experiment-names

Crater tries to predict what the name of the experiment you're working on is,
and in those cases you aren't required to explicitly provide one during
commands. At the moment, the name is predicted in these cases:

* If you already used a name in the issue/PR, that name is reused by default
  for future requests
* If you didn't use a name before and you're in a PR, `pr-NUMBER` is used as
  default (for example `pr-12345`)

## Commands reference

### Creating experiments

[h-cmd-run]: #creating-experiments

You can create experiments with the `run` command. For example, to create a
beta run you can use:

```
@craterbot run name=foobar start=stable end=beta cap-lints=allow
```

* `name`: name of the experiment; required only if Crater [can't determine it
  automatically][h-experiment-names]
* `start`: name of the first toolchain; can be either a rustup name or
  `branch#sha` (required)
* `end`: name of the second toolchain; can be either a rustup name or
  `branch#sha` (required)
* `mode`: the experiment mode (default: `build-and-test`)
* `crates`: the selection of crates to use (default: `full`)
* `cap-lints`: the lints cap (default: `forbid`, which means no cap)
* `ignore-blacklist`: whether the blacklist should be ignored (default: `false`)
* `p`: the priority of the run (default: `0`)

[Go back to the TOC][h-toc]

### Editing experiments

[h-cmd-edit]: #creating-experiments

Experiments can be edited as long as they're queued. To edit an experiment,
send a command with the options you want to change. For example, to change the
priority of the `foo` experiment you can use:

```
@craterbot name=foo p=1
```

* `name`: name of the experiment; required only if Crater [can't determine it
  automatically][h-experiment-names]
* `start`: name of the first toolchain; can be either a rustup name or
  `branch#sha` (required)
* `end`: name of the second toolchain; can be either a rustup name or
  `branch#sha` (required)
* `mode`: the experiment mode (default: `build-and-test`)
* `crates`: the selection of crates to use (default: `full`)
* `cap-lints`: the lints cap (default: `forbid`, which means no cap)
* `ignore-blacklist`: whether the blacklist should be ignored (default: `false`)
* `p`: the priority of the run (default: `0`)

### Aborting experiments

[h-cmd-abort]: #aborting-experiments

If you don't want to run an experiment anymore, you can use the `abort`
command. For example, to abort an experiment named `foo` you can use:

```
@craterbot abort name=foo
```

* `name`: name of the experiment; required only if Crater [can't determine it
  automatically][h-experiment-names]

## Troubleshooting

Crater allows some troubleshooting actions to be done directly from the bot.
These steps should only be performed by the infra team though.

### Regenerating a report if it failed

[h-troubleshooting-retry-report]: #regenerating-a-report-if-it-failed

If a report generation failed, the first thing to do should be to read the
server logs and fix the problem (tip: the server logs contains the full error
message). After doing that it's possible to restart the report generation
without restarting the whole experiment, with the GitHub command
`retry-report`:

```
@craterbot retry-report name=foo
```

* `name`: name of the experiment; required only if Crater [can't determine it
  automatically][h-experiment-names]

## Reload the list of GitHub team members

[h-troubleshooting-reload-teams]: #reload-the-list-of-github-team-members

Crater allows members of some teams (configured in `config.toml`) to interact
with the GitHub bot, but the list of members is only loaded at startup. If a
member joined or was removed from a team, you need to reload that list.

It's possible to reload the list either restarting the Crater server or using
the `reload-acl` command, which requires no arguments:

```
@craterbot reload-acl
```
